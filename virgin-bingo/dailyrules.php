The Sweepstakes is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations and is void where prohibited.  Participation constitutes entrant's full and unconditional agreement to these Official Rules and Sponsor's and Administrator's decisions, which are final and binding in all matters related to the Sweepstakes.  Winning a prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein.</li>

	<li><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Virgin America, Inc., 555 Airport Blvd., Burlingame, CA 94010. Administrator: ePrize, Inc., One ePrize Drive, Pleasant Ridge, MI 48069.</li>

	<li><strong>Timing:</strong> The Sweepstakes begins on August 8, 2013 at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time ("ET"), ends on September 6, 2013 at 11:59 p.m. ET (the "Promotion Period") and consists of thirty (30) days (each a "Daily Entry Period").  Mindspace, Inc.'s computer is the official time-keeping device for the Sweepstakes.</li>

	<li>
		<strong>How to Enter:</strong> There are two (2) ways to enter during the Promotion Period:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Play Go Big Bingo:</strong> Visit <a href="http://gobigbingo.virginamerica.com">http://gobigbingo.virginamerica.com</a> and play Go Big Bingo by answering trivia questions to uncover spaces. Once you have achieved Bingo, follow the links and instructions to complete and submit the registration form including a valid email address, and click to enter the Daily Prize drawing. You automatically will receive one (1) entry into the applicable Daily Entry Period drawing.</li>
			<li><strong>Enter Without Playing Go Big Bingo:</strong> Visit <a href="http://gobigbingo.virginamerica.com">http://gobigbingo.virginamerica.com</a> and follow the links and instructions to complete and submit the registration form including a valid email address, and click to enter the Daily Prize drawing. You automatically will receive one (1) entry into the applicable Daily Entry Period drawing.</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Limit:</strong> You may enter one (1) time per Daily Entry Period during the Promotion Period.  Multiple entrants are not permitted to share the same email address.  Any attempt by any entrant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using multiple/different email addresses, identities, registrations and logins, or any other methods will void that entrant's entries and that entrant may be disqualified.  Use of any automated system to participate is prohibited and will result in disqualification.  In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register will be deemed to be the entrant.  The "authorized account holder" is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address.  The potential winner may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder.
	</li>
  
	<li><strong>Drawings:</strong> Administrator is an independent judging organization whose decisions as to the administration and operation of the Sweepstakes and the selection of the potential winners are final and binding in all matters related to the Sweepstakes.  Administrator will randomly select the potential Sweepstakes winners from all eligible entries received during each applicable Daily Entry Period, on or around September 16, 2013. Non-winning Daily Entry Period entries will not carry over into subsequent Daily Entry Period drawings. The potential winners will be notified by email or phone.  Except where prohibited, each potential winner of a prize with an approximate retail value ("ARV") over $600 (or parent/legal guardian if winner is a minor in his/her state of residence) will be required to sign and return a Declaration of Compliance, Liability and Publicity Release ("Declaration") which must be received by Administrator, within seven (7) days of the date notice or attempted notice is sent, in order to claim the prize.  If a potential winner cannot be contacted, fails to sign and return the Declaration (if applicable) or provide any other requested information, within the required time period, or the prize is returned as undeliverable, the potential winner forfeits the prize.  Receiving a prize is contingent upon compliance with these Official Rules.  In the event that a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor will award the prize to an alternate winner by random drawing from among all remaining eligible entries.  Only three (3) alternate drawings will be held, after which the prize will remain un-awarded. Prize will be fulfilled approximately 8-10 weeks after the conclusion of the Sweepstakes.</li>

	<li>
		<p><strong>Prizes:</strong> There will be thirty (30) prize categories, which are listed below. One (1) category of prizes will be awarded per one (1) Daily Entry Period, and no Daily Entry Period will have the same prize category. The specific prize category awarded for each Daily Entry Period will be determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion.</p>
