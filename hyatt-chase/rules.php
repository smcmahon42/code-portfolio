					<li><b>OVERVIEW.</b> The Chase Game Promotion ("Promotion") begins at 10:00:00 a.m. Central Time ("CST") on September 9, 2013 and ends at 11:59:59 p.m. CSTon October 31, 2013 (the "Promotion Period"). The Promotion consists of two (2) distinct elements, a "Game" and a "Sweepstakes", in which select Hyatt Gold Passport members will be invited to participate by Hyatt Corporation ("Sponsor"), as more fully described in the eligibility section below. The Game and the Sweepstakes will function as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>The Game: To participate in the Game entitled "The Chase", eligible individuals (See Section 3 below for eligibility requirements) will use fictitious cash and Hyatt Gold Passport points to travel around the globe in search of three (3) trunks ("Trunks"), as more fully described in Section 2 below. Depending on your Game play, you may find anywhere from zero (0) to three (3) Trunks at the final destination in your Game play, which destinations can be hotels in cities around the world or locations within hotels (each, a "Location"). In other words, the Locations to which you decide to travel (based on the scenarios presented during the Game) will affect the number of Trunks that you locate at the completion of the Game. At the completion of Game play, you may choose to open the number of Trunks that you have located to reveal the Hyatt Gold Passport rewards inside them (the "Rewards", as described further in Section 5 below, including important restrictions and limitations on use of those Rewards), or you may give up those Trunks and play the Game again to try to play for more (or different) Trunks. Be careful: Once a Trunk is opened, you can continue to play the Game for fun an unlimited number of times, but will not be able to play for additional Rewards beyond those available in the Trunk(s) originally opened. When you choose to open your Trunk(s), you must confirm (or enter, if not pre-populated) your Hyatt Gold Passport account number before opening and, once opened, you may choose only one (1) of the Rewards revealed. </li>
							<li>The Sweepstakes: One of the Rewards available in the Trunks may be entry into the Sweepstakes. If this Reward is selected in accordance with the instructions in Section 2 below, you will automatically be entered for a chance to win the Sweepstakes and the prize associated with the Sweepstakes ("Prize"), which Prize is more fully descried in Section 5 below including important restrictions and limitations on use of the Prize. </li>
						</ul>
						By confirming (or entering) your Hyatt Gold Passport membership number and opening a Trunk, you will also automatically be registered in the Hyatt Gold Passport "New Possibilities" offer, which provides eligible Hyatt Gold Passport members the opportunity to earn bonus points on eligible stays completed by November 30, 2013 (subject to the limitations and restrictions set forth in the terms for the New Possibilities offer available at goldpassport.com/possibilities). You must confirm (or enter) and submit your Hyatt Gold Passport membership number and register for the New Possibilities promotion to be eligible to receive a Reward or win a Prize in this Promotion. </li>
					<!-- OVERVIEW -->
					
					<li><b>HOW TO PARTICIPATE.</b> Eligible individuals can play the Game (and enter the Sweepstakes, if entry into the Sweepstakes becomes available during Game play as described below), by clicking on the link in the email sent to eligible Hyatt Gold Passport members by Sponsor inviting them to play the Game and following all links and instructions to access the web site for this Promotion ("Website").
						<div class="ulHead">THE GAME: The Game can be played as follows: </div>
						<ul>
							<li>Object of the Game:
								<ul>
									<li>You will start the Game with three (3) Trunks in play.  Your object is to guess a Location to travel to next at each stage of the Game to keep your Trunk(s) in play, travel from Location to Location around the globe using fictitious cash and Hyatt Gold Passport points, and, if you guessed correctly throughout the Game, end up with three (3) Trunks at the completion of Game play. </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<!-- Object of the Game: -->
							<li>Playing the Game:
								<ul>
									<li>You will earn fictitious Hyatt Gold Passport points and spend fictitious cash throughout play. IMPORTANT: POINTS AND CASH DISPLAYED AND SPENT DURING THE GAME (OTHER THAN IN THE TRUNKS) ARE FICTICIOUS, FOR PURPOSES OF GAME PLAY ONLY, AND WILL NOT BE AWARDED OR ADDED TO OR DELETED FROM YOUR HYATT GOLD PASSPORT ACCOUNT. </li>
									<li>At each Location, you will be presented with a scenario about where the current Location of the Trunk(s) might be and a choice between two (2) Locations of where to go next to keep your Trunk(s) in play. </li>
									<li>If you guess the wrong Location to visit next, a virtual opponent ("Opponent") will steal one of your Trunks. If you continue to guess the wrong Location to visit next, your Opponent will steal your Trunks one by one until you are left with no Trunks and that Game will be over.  Once a Trunk is stolen it is permanently out of play for that Game. </li>
									<li>If you guess the right Location to visit next, your Trunk(s) will remain in play. </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<!-- Playing the Game: -->
							<li>Completing the Game:
								<ul>
									<li>The Game will continue until you either
										<ol>
											<li>Arrive at the final Game Location, with zero trunks and choose to redeem the default Reward that is available when no Trunks are in play ("Default Reward"); or </li>
											<li>Arrive at the final Game Location, at which point you may have one (1) to three (3) Trunks in play, depending upon the guesses you made throughout the Game. </li>
										</ol>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<!-- Completing the Game: -->
							<li>Choosing your Reward:
								<ul>
									<li>If you would like to try for more Trunks or something beyond the Default Reward if you were left with no Trunks: Click on the "Replay" (or similar) button and start the Game from the beginning. </li>
									<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: Once you open Trunk(s), you can continue to play the Game an unlimited number of times for fun, but will not be able to play for additional Rewards beyond those available in the Trunk(s) opened. </li>
									<li>If you would like to open your Trunks: Prior to clicking on the "Open Trunks" (or similar) button to open your Trunk(s), you must enter or confirm (if the entry field is pre-populated) your Hyatt Gold Passport account number. Then, you must follow the on-screen instructions and links to choose one (1) Reward from among the option(s) available in your open Trunks.  If you do not choose a Reward at this point in the Game, you cannot redeem any Reward during future Game play—this will be your last chance to redeem a Reward. Entry in the Sweepstakes may be one of the options available in the Trunks, as described more fully below. Rewards are subject to the terms and conditions detailed in Section 5 below and all documents linked from that section. </li>
									<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: You will be automatically registered to participate in the New Possibilities offer by providing your Hyatt Gold Passport membership number and following the on-screen instructions to "Open the Trunks." </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<!-- Choosing your Reward: -->
						</ul>
						<!-- THE GAME: The Game can be played as follows: -->
						<div class="ulHead">THE SWEEPSTAKES:</div>
						<ul>
							<li>To enter the Sweepstakes, you must first encounter the option of entering the Sweepstakes upon opening your Trunk(s).  If you do not encounter this option upon opening your Trunks, you are not eligible to enter this Sweepstakes. </li>
							<li>You may enter the Sweepstakes by selecting "Entry to Win 5 Nights at any Hyatt Hotel" as your Reward upon opening your Trunk(s), if available. </li>
							<li>If the "Entry to Win 5 Nights at any Hyatt Hotel" was made available to you as a Trunk option, but you would prefer to choose a different Trunk Reward, you may enter the Sweepstakes by mail instead by hand print in blue or black ink on a 3"x5" card your full name, complete address (no PO Boxes), phone # (w/ area code), date of birth, and email address (if available), and mail it in a postage-paid envelope to "The Chase Sweepstakes Mail-in Entry, Hyatt Corporation, Attn: Hyatt Gold Passport Manager, 71 S. Wacker Dr., Chicago, IL 60606."  Limit one (1) entry per envelope.  Mail-in entries must be postmarked during the Promotion Period and received by November 6, 2013. </li>

						</ul>
						<!-- THE SWEEPSTAKES: --> 
						There is a limit of one (1) Reward or Prize (including the Default Reward) per person and per Hyatt Gold Passport account (i.e., you may only click the "Open Trunks" (or similar) button or accept a Default Reward one (1) time over the course of the entire Promotion Period). The Website's database clock will be the official timekeeper for this Promotion. All activities required to receive Rewards, including entry into the Sweepstakes, if available, must be performed and completed during the Promotion Period through the Website. For purposes of this Promotion, an activity is completed when the Website's servers record the activity or related information. Proof of sending (such as, without limitation, a printed, saved or copied automated receipt, screen, or message) does not constitute proof of actual completion of an activity for purposes of this Promotion. Those who do not provide the required Hyatt Gold Passport account information, complete Game play, or abide by these Official Rules and other instructions of Sponsor will be disqualified. Participation in the Game and entry into the Sweepstakes may not be acknowledged and information submitted will not be returned. Participation that is forged, altered, incomplete, lost, late, misdirected, mutilated, illegitimate, garbled, postage-due, illegible, or generated by a macro, bot, or other automated means will not be accepted and will be void. Participation by any other individual or any entity, and/or originating at any other website or e-mail address, including, without limitation, commercial sweepstakes subscription notification and/or entering service sites, will be declared invalid and disqualified for this Promotion.  As a condition of participating in this Promotion, each participant gives consent for Sponsor to obtain and deliver his or her name, address and other information to third parties for the purpose of administering this Promotion and complying with applicable laws, regulations and rules.  Any attempt made to participate, receive a Reward, or win a Prize in excess of any limit or otherwise in violation of these Official Rules by using multiple or false contact information or otherwise may be disqualified. </li>

Corporate entities are not eligible and have no right to claim any Prize won or Reward received by their employees. Employees and agents of the Sponsor, Mindspace Inc., and their respective parents, divisions, affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising agencies or promotional partners associated with this Promotion, and relatives of and those living in the same household as such individuals are not eligible to enter, receive a Reward, or win a Prize. For the purpose of this Promotion, relatives are defined as spouse, partner, parent, legal guardian, in-law, grandparent, sibling, children and grandchildren.

					<!-- 3.	ELIGIBILITY -->
					<li><b>ODDS/SELECTION OF REWARDS RECIPIENTS AND WINNERS:</b> Odds of receiving a particular Reward in the Game depend on the number of Game participants and Location selections made during Game play. Odds of winning the Sweepstakes depend on the number of eligible entries received by Sponsor.
						<p><b>Game:</b> Rewards will be awarded if the Trunk containing that Reward is opened and selected, subject to verification by Sponsor (including, without limitation, verification of the eligibility of the potential recipient's Hyatt Gold Passport account), in accordance with the timeframe set forth in Section 5 below for the specific Reward selected. </p>
						<p><b>Sweepstakes:</b> At or about 10:00am CT on November 30, 2013, a random drawing from among all eligible entries received for the Sweepstakes will be conducted by Sponsor's designated agent/representative, whose decisions are final, to determine the six (6) winners of the Sweepstakes, subject to verification (including, without limitation, verification of the eligibility of the potentially winning Hyatt Gold Passport account). Sponsor or its designee will attempt to notify each potential winner that he or she may have won a Prize in this Sweepstakes by mail, e-mail, or telephone (at Sponsor's sole discretion) approximately 7 days after the drawing. The Sweepstakes winners may be required to complete, sign, have notarized (if applicable) and return, without alteration and in the form presented by Sponsor, an affidavit of eligibility and liability/publicity release (unless prohibited by law) (or Declaration of Eligibility, Liability/Publicity Release for Canadian residents) and tax forms (if applicable), both of which may require each winner to provide his or her Social Security Number (for U.S. residents), within the time frame specified by Sponsor or Prize may be forfeited. In the event of noncompliance with these requirements, the Prize may be forfeited. The winner documents are subject to verification by Sponsor. If a potential Sweepstakes winner cannot be reached after a reasonable attempt has been made by Sponsor or does not respond according to the notification's or Sponsor's instructions (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion), that winner or potential winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be randomly selected; Sponsor will not be obligated to pursue more than three (3) alternate winners for any reason, in which case some Prizes may go unawarded. If any Prize notification or Promotion-related communication is rejected, faulty, or returned as undeliverable, or if the winner cannot attend or participate in any portion of the Prize, Sponsor reserves the right to modify the notification procedures in connection with the selection of any alternate potential winner, if any. </p>
						<p>The following is applicable to all Rewards recipients and Sweepstakes Prize winners: NOTE: All Canadian residents who win a Reward in the Game or a Prize in the Sweepstakes may be required to correctly answer a mathematical skill-testing question without mechanical aid or assistance. </p>
